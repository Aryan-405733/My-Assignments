    <p>Information technology has long been viewed as the power behind a new economic revolution 
        — an evolving set of tools that has made workers much more productive than ever before, 
        powering a step change as dramatic as steam or electricity. According to a report by the 
        World Economic Forum, “digitization boosted world economic output by nearly US$200 billion 
        and created 6 million jobs in 2011.”1 On a company-by-company basis, a number of studies have
         found that companies that use more IT have higher productivity than their competitors.
          However, we may be entering an era in which human frailties begin to slow down progress
           from digital technologies.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">In a series of studies,
            we explored the implications of
            IT-induced technology stress, technology addiction and IT misuse in the workplace. 
            (See “About the Research.”) One implication of our findings is that the very qualities 
            that make IT useful — reliability, portability, user-friendliness and fast processing — may
             also be undermining employee productivity, innovation and well-being.
 After observing a number of organizations, we found that this rapidly emerging “dark side” of IT hurts employees
  and their organizations and robs companies of some of the productivity gains they expect from their IT 
  investments. In this article, we describe key negative effects of IT use in the workplace, explain the risks
   they pose, and suggest ways managers can mitigate their impact.
